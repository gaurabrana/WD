<h1>The Crushing Bore</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: The dark night</h2>
<p>It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the ...</p>

<h3>The specter speaks</h3>
<p>Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"</p>
<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
   <p>hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
      <li>175g of tahini</li>
      <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
      <li>Half a red pepper</li>
      <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
      <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
    <p>hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
